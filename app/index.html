                        <p>Each month during the season the Premier League awards Player of the Month &#40;<span class="caps">potm&#41;</span> to an outstanding player in the league. Voting consists of a panel of experts, club captains, and a public vote. The public vote factors in as ten percent of the final tally.</p>
                        <p>The award is almost always given to an attacking player from the club with the best record in the league during the past month, or to the player who scored the most goals in the league during that time period, if their club has done well.</p>
                        <p>The last non striker or winger to win <span class="caps">potm</span> was Dele Alli in January of 2017, before that it was Fraser Forster in February of 2016.</p>
                        <p>The award is sponsored by <span class="caps">ea</span> Sports.</p>

                        <p>I have always been a sports geek. I love nerding out to sports history, stats, uniforms, stadiums, etc.</p>
                        <p>Soccer is one of my favorite sports and and I love the Premier League. I actually enjoy getting up early on Saturdays to watch the Premier League matches while I drink my coffee.</p>
                        <p><span class="caps">potm</span> also corresponds with one of my favorite guilty pleasures, <span class="caps">ea</span> Sports <span class="caps">fifa</span> Ultimate Team. &#40;I can nerd out about that with you all day, but that&#39;s a different story&#41;.</p>
                        <p>I enjoy breaking down the stats for clubs and players to decide who I think will win <span class="caps">potm</span>. It&#39;s fun to see which clubs and players are in form. Last season I correctly predicted the <span class="caps">potm</span> in all but one month.</p>
